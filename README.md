# code-snippets

## What is this?
This is a collection of boiler plate code/snippets that I have written 
for other people. Each collection has a local readme file that should detail 
what the repository is about, how to run it, and what the code means.

## Licenses 
There is a general MIT license attached to this repository but I don't care. 
Use the code here in whatever way you would like. However, in the case of 
using this code for educational purposes, I ask that you provide a link/reference 
this specific repository so people can know how they can learn more about the 
code or ask the developer (me) for more questions.
