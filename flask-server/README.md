# How to run

## Install

First you need to have python3. Get that and then you can navigate to the root directory of the this folder and on macOS (check how to do it on other platforms) you can run 
```bash
pip3 install flask
```

and then (this is just an init for flask step so they know where to start)
```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```
and then run
```bash
flask run
```


and you should be able to go into your browser and visit
http://localhost:5000
